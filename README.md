# Twitch Chat Counter

Adds a counter badge below the twitch chat input field that tracks your progress toward a daily chat quota. The badge changes colors as you meet daily milestones, and an "achievement" popup goes off with sound effects when meeting said milestones. Additionally adds a second counter badge to keep track of number of messages that are @ the user and provides a list of those messages in a popup modal.
