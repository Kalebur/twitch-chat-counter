# Twitch Chat Counter Chrome Extensions

## What Does This Do?

Adds a counter badge below the twitch chat input field that tracks your progress toward a daily chat quota. The badge changes colors as you meet daily milestones, and an "achievement" popup goes off with sound effects when meeting said milestones. Additionally adds a second counter badge to keep track of number of messages that are @ the user and provides a list of those messages in a popup modal.

## Why Did I Make This?

I watch Twitch a lot, but I rarely ever chat. I wanted to change that, so I set a goal to send a handful of messages per day in the streams I watch most. Unfortunately, it's hard to keep track of just how many messages I've sent unless I send them all in a short period of time. The goal quickly fell apart, but then I thought _"Hey, why don't I make something to help me keep track of just how much I chat each day?"_ I had been curious about how Chrome browser extensions were made, so I decided to give it a shot!
